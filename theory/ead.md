# Equivalent air depth

The equivalent air depth (EAD) is a way of approximating the decompression requirements of breathing gas mixtures that contain nitrogen and oxygen in different proportions to those in air, known as nitrox.

The equivalent air depth, for a given nitrox mix and depth, is the depth of a dive when breathing air that would have the same partial pressure of nitrogen. So, for example, a gas mix containing 36% oxygen (EAN36) being used at 27 metres (89 ft) has an EAD of 20 metres (66 ft).

## Calculation in metres
The equivalent air depth can be calculated for depths in metres as follows:

EAD = (Depth + 10) × (Fraction of N2 / 0.79) − 10
Working the earlier example, for a nitrox mix containing 64% nitrogen (EAN36) being used at 27 metres, the EAD is:

EAD = (27 + 10) × (0.64 / 0.79) − 10
EAD = 37 × 0.81 − 10
EAD = 30 − 10
EAD = 20 metres
So at 27 metres on this mix, the diver would calculate their decompression requirements as if on air at 20 metres.


## Calculations in feet
The equivalent air depth can be calculated for depths in feet as follows:

EAD = (Depth + 33) × (Fraction of N2 / 0.79) − 33
Working the earlier example, for a nitrox mix containing 64% nitrogen (EAN36) being used at 90 feet, the EAD is:

EAD = (90 + 33) × (0.64 / 0.79) − 33
EAD = 123 × 0.81 − 33
EAD = 100 − 33
EAD = 67 feet
So at 90 feet on this mix, the diver would calculate their decompression requirements as if on air at 67 feet.
